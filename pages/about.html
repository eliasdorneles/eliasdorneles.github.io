    <p>Hello, I'm Elias Dorneles, a human originally from Brazil üáßüá∑Ô∏è, living in France üá´üá∑Ô∏è.</p>
<p>I work as a software developer, notably with <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a>
and web technologies. I'm currently studying a humanistic approach to
psychotherapy called <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/transactional-analysis">Transactional
Analysis</a>,
hoping to become a practicing psychotherapist.</p>
<p>In this blog I write about personal experiences, books I've read, software
development, opinions about technology and more.</p>
<p>I come from a very musical family, I play the guitar and the piano, as a hobby.
I like learning new pieces at the guitar and coming up with arrangements for
songs that I like. I also enjoy just playing for people to sing along.</p>
<p>In 2017, I've attended the <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>, a retreat
for programmers in NYC to get dramatically better at programming. This was a
great experience where I learned a lot and that gave me plenty of courage.</p>
<p>I'm currently working for <a href="https://www.backmarket.fr">Back Market</a>, which has
the fine mission of making reconditioned products reliable and desirable. The
views expressed in this blog are mine and mine alone, and do not represent my
employer in any way.</p>
<p>You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/149872/elias?tab=profile">Stackoverflow</a>.</p>

<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>I'm fond of open source software, and in the past I have been active notably in the Python open source community. I've been maintainer of <a href="https://pybee.org">BeeWare</a>, where I helped maintain <a href="https://github.com/pybee/voc">VOC</a> and the Android tooling.</p>
<p>Some other projects I collaborated on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scrapy/parsel">parsel</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.scrapy.org">Scrapy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scrapinghub/dateparser">dateparser</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage">cookiecutter-pypackage</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some that I've created/co-created but don't maintain anymore:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles/fretprinting">fretprinting</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scrapinghub/flatson">flatson</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scrapinghub/skinfer">skinfer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Plus others you can check at my <a href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles">GitHub profile</a>.</p>
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>I like to write. It helps me to think and it's nice to have a trace of the
ideas and thoughts that went through my head. Most of what I write I keep it
private though.</p>
<p>Online, besides writing on <a href="/">this blog</a>, I also collaborate on <a href="https://pythonhelp.wordpress.com">Python
Help</a>, a resource in Portuguese for Python
programmers.</p>
<p>I've also translated to Portuguese the wonderful little book
<a href="http://buildyourownlisp.com">Build Your Own Lisp</a>

<a href="https://construa-seu-proprio-lisp.herokuapp.com/">Construa Seu Pr√≥prio Lisp</a>.</p>
