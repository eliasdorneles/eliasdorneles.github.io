## 1: Avoid Telling the User What the Product Allows

Don’t use “X allows you to Y” constructions. Thanks to @kirstyt for pointing
this out on Twitter and placing it prominently in my consciousness. Instead of
saying what X allows the user to do, say something like “Using X, do Y.”

Avoid Allow’s brother, Can. Don’t tell the user he can do it. Just go straight
to telling him how. Almost nothing frustrates me more when looking for help
than to be told I can do something but not be told how. Not being told how
disproves the statement that I can. This is a quick way to brand your help as
useless.

## 2: Keep Things in the Right Tense

When you have to give some narration about what the product does, narrate in
the correct tense. If you instruct the user to click a button, don’t say that
her information will be submitted. This suggests that this will happen at some
unspecified time in the future. Instead, the information is submitted.

## 3: Avoid Judgment Calls on Ease or Simplicity

Avoid words like easily (or easy), simply (or simple), and just. These words
are a matter of opinion. For more on this, see an earlier post on adverbial
crutches and Alan Pringle’s discussion of the cardinal sin of tech writing.


## 4: Avoid Words That Sound Technical When Another Will Do

Unless your audience is technically advanced, avoid techie words like generate
(create), execute (run), initiate (start), terminate (end), authenticate
(verify), validate (check).

## 5: Leave out Unnecessary Phrases

Leave out phrases that are completely unnecessary, like “in order to” and “be
able to.” Most of the time, you can just say “to.”

## 6: Cut out Redundancy

Understand the words you’re using so you can avoid redundancies like “lift up”
or “return again” (most people don’t mean “come back for the second time” when
they say “return again,” which means “here for the third time”). I found myself
doing this with “each one” the other day. The “one” isn’t needed.

My favorite is “the reason for that is because,” since because means “for the
reason that.” So what you’re really saying is “the reason is that for the
reason that.” Nice. Just say “the reason is.” I encounter this in speech more
than writing, but watch out for it in writing too.

## 7: Use “Please” Sparingly

I know what your mother taught you, but she was talking about human
interactions, not technical instructions. When you’re telling someone how to do
something, you’re not making requests. Please suggests optionality. Usually
either the person should do something, or he shouldn’t. If you don’t believe me
on this one, sit with someone at the computer and explain how to use Google
search. Start every other statement with “please,” and you’ll quickly see how
unnecessary it is. It’s no different in help text.

Occasionally it’s appropriate, but only when you’re requesting something:
“Please send your feedback about the application to feedback@kadoodlydim.com.”

Please leave out the please.

## 8: Say It Like It Is

On the subject of optionality, don’t use “should” if an action is really a
must. Again, most of the time, either they do it or they don’t. Tell them to do
it or not do it; don’t tell them they should or shouldn’t. Tell it like it is
so people aren’t left with questions (or drastic consequences).

## 9: Don’t Use False Subjects

Avoid false subjects like “There is” or “there are.” Usually, to fix these, you
can just move the real subject up front. “There are many options in the
Preferences panel” should be “The Preferences panel contains many options.”
That doesn’t sound like something you’d actually write, but you get the
picture.

## 10: Just Click

If documenting software, say “click” instead of “click on.” We’ve been clicking
long enough that we don’t really need the on.

## 11: Let Your Headings Say It

Use informative headings, and let them speak for themselves as much as
possible. This is more of a general guideline with all sorts of room for
application.

## 12: Give the Shortest Route from A to B

If there are two or more ways to do something, provide the shortest way. Don’t
confuse the issue by providing multiple sets of steps. If there are different
reasons to take the different paths, explain why the user would do each. For
example, don’t say “Press Ctrl+C, or right-click and select Copy.” Pick one,
and if the user’s savvy enough, she’ll use the alternative if that’s her
preference.

## 13: Use Active Voice

Almost goes without saying, but don’t use passive voice if at all possible not
to. In tech docs, it’s often essential to know who does what. Passive voice
hides who does it. For example, “New employees are sent a welcome packet.” Who
sends? The user? Someone else? The system does it automatically? It’s probably
important to know. Your English teacher may say that passive voice takes more
words, but I think the net gain is one word when you go from passive to active
voice. The more important point is that active voice is clearer.

(Did you catch the false subject in that paragraph? “It’s.” Hey, I’m just
blogging here.)

## Wrap-Up

There you have it, a nice round 13 guidelines. If you find yourself breaking
these guidelines, either have a specific reason, or remember that a second
draft is your friend.
