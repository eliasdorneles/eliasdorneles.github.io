## Open Source

I'm a fond of open source software, and in the past I have been active notably in the Python open source community. I've been maintainer of [BeeWare](https://pybee.org), where I helped maintain [VOC](https://github.com/pybee/voc) and the Android tooling.

Some other projects I collaborated on:

* [parsel](https://github.com/scrapy/parsel)
* [Scrapy](https://www.scrapy.org)
* [dateparser](https://github.com/scrapinghub/dateparser)
* [cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage)

Here are some that I've created/co-created but don't maintain anymore:

* [fretprinting](https://github.com/eliasdorneles/fretprinting)
* [flatson](https://github.com/scrapinghub/flatson)
* [skinfer](https://github.com/scrapinghub/skinfer)

## Writing

Besides writing on [this blog](/), I also collaborate on [Python
Help](https://pythonhelp.wordpress.com), a resource in Portuguese for Python
programmers.

I've also translated to Portuguese the wonderful little book

[Construa Seu Pr√≥prio Lisp](https://construa-seu-proprio-lisp.herokuapp.com/).
