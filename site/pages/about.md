## Open Source

I'm mostly active in the Python open source community. I'm one of the maintainers of [BeeWare](https://pybee.org), where I help maintain [VOC](https://github.com/pybee/voc) and the Android tooling.

* [Scrapy](https://www.scrapy.org)
* [dateparser](https://github.com/scrapinghub/dateparser)
* [cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage)

Here are some that I've created/co-created but don't maintain anymore:

## Writing

Besides writing on [this blog](/), I also collaborate on [Python
Help](https://pythonhelp.wordpress.com), a resource in Portuguese for Python
programmers.

I've also translated to Portuguese the wonderful little book
