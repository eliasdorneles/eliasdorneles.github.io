Hello, I'm Elias Dorneles, a software developer from Brazil.
I play the guitar and the piano a little bit, and I love to learn new things.

I work at [Scrapinghub](http://scrapinghub.com) building stuff for storing,
processing and moving huge datasets of scraped data.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eliasdorneles), [Github](https://github.com/eliasdorneles) and
