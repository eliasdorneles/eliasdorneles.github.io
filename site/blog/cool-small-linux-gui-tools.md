Here are some cool Linux apps you might not know yet.

### sm -- or, screen message

[sm](https://packages.debian.org/sid/sm) is a small app to display text big and fullscreen.

Simple as that.

### Flameshot

[flameshot](https://flameshot.js.org) is an awesome app for making screenshots.

I've mapped my <kbd>PrintScr</kbd> key to launch `flameshot gui`.

### Play it slowly

[Play It Slowly](https://29a.ch/playitslowly) is an app to play an audio or video slower (or faster), while keeping (or otherwise manipulating) the pitch.

If you're a musician, you can use this to play some audio slower to be able to focus more closely on a small piece of a song.

If you're a singer, you can use this to play a track in a tonality that suits your voice better, while keeping the same tempo.

### Solfege

[Solfege](https://www.gnu.org/software/solfege/) is a tool for ear-training. You can use this to practice identifying intervals, rhythms, chords, scales, etc.

To be honest I never used it that much...  It's a pretty cool piece of software
and I suppose it will appeal to people who are used to music notation.
