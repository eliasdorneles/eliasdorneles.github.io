Those who know me well, know that I'm a bit of a [Steve
Yegge](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/) fanboy. That's true, I love reading
Steve's mean jokes and I keep coming back to those long blog posts. That dude's
writing has been a great influence to me. I've even started to write long posts
myself, in a sort of cargo-cult-steve-yegge-wannabe behavior. I'm such a
fanboy. Steve would probably feel embarrassed for me.

Anyway, I discovered a while ago that he has quietly released a book called [A
Programmer's Rantings: On Programming-Language Religions, Code Philosophies,
Google Work Culture and Other
Stuff](http://www.hyperink.com/A-Programmers-Rantings-On-Programminglanguage-Religions-Code-Philosophies-Google-Work-Culture-And-Other-Stuff-b40632A90DD),
which is a collection of some of his articles put together with a few notes
adding a bit more context to each article. It was published by
[HyperInk](http://hyperink.com/), which seems to be a cool company. I bought
the ebook from their website and it offered me to send as a gift to a few
friends, so it was a nice deal.

And the book is quite a journey. You get to read some of the first essays Steve
wrote when he was pretty unknown (just another bright young fellow at Amazon)
and also his latest rants posted on [Google
Plus](https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts), including the one
he made public accidentally and it ended up making him kind of famous outside
of the programming circles too.

I enjoyed reading this book a lot, although I suppose it would be expected
for me say that, what with me being a fanboy and all. That being said, it's a
quick read and lot's of fun -- highly recommended! Although it amounts to more
than two hundred pages it still does not make half of the stuff on
[his](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/blog-rants)
[blogs](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com.br/).  So, if you like the book, you'll
probably want to check out the blogs.  Or vice-versa, whatever.
