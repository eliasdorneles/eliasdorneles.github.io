This repository contains the code for my website.

The sitegen/ folder contains my homegrown static site generator
written in [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/docs/overview).
It contains also my homegrown template engine, with Jinja-like syntax.

The manage/ folder contains a small tool to facilitate writing posts.

Look at the commands inside the Makefile to see how to compile and run the tests.
