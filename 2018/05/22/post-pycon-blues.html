            <p>When I arrived at Cleveland's airport a few weeks ago to attend
<a href="https://us.pycon.org">Pycon</a>, the customs agent didn't know that
there was a tech conference happening in town.
I'm sure many other people knew something was going on, because
I was welcomed by a screen just after she checked my documents and let me in.
It was a nice gesture, and it surely put a smile on my tired sleepy face!</p>
<p><img src="../../..//images/hello_pycon_2018.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Pycon is a great conference, because it's really several events at the same
time, it goes a lot more than just people presenting talks. In fact I barely
watch any talk: since the talks are recorded and are available online very
quickly, I prefer to profit of the time there to just talk to people, see old
friends, make new ones, talk to my open source buddies and also harass
famous cool people asking them to take pictures with me!</p>
<img src="../../..//images/pycon_roomies.jpg" class="align-right"/>
<p>It was my third Pycon this year, and I feel already so at home with those
folks! Some of my dearest friends are people from the Python community, and I'm
grateful to have this opportunity to go see them in the same place every year!
Since I live far away from many of them, it is really great to be able to be
with them.  The only difficult part is to manage splitting my time among them,
because I love them all -- and even if I'd love to take them all home with me,
I don't think my roommate would accept that.</p>
<p>Pycon is also a special time also because it's when I get to see <a href="https://pybee.org/community/team/">my cheerful
buddies who maintain BeeWare</a>, which have
welcomed me to the team about an year ago.  This time I got to meet the awesome
<a href="https://twitter.com/danyeaw">Dan Yeaw</a> who I only knew from the online chat,
and is a super nice person (so nice in fact, that some people say that he is
Canadian... jk)! We had a booth in the space dedicated to open source projects,
where we had to explain several times that <a href="https://pybee.org">BeeWare</a> is not
really about an IDE (anymore).  It's always fun being around these folks,
preaching the BeeWare word, sharing stories, and I always learn a lot from
them.</p>
<p><img src="../../..//images/beeware_not_an_ide.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>One of my favorite things at Pycon are the open source sprints, which btw <a href="http://blog.zulip.org/2016/10/13/static-types-in-python-oh-mypy/">have
already been described as a
party</a>.  This
is essentially, a bunch of people excited about open source getting together
and doing open source things: writing code, writing docs, trying out stuff, get
feedback from users trying out stuff, debug issues, discuss implementation
ideas, and more!  I always come back full of ideas and positive thoughts from
this!</p>
<p>BeeWare sprints are specially cool because it's kind of a big deal when you get
your first pull-request merged in a project: basically, <a href="https://pybee.org/contributing/challenge-coins/">you get a coin as
acknowledgment for the
contribution</a> and everyone
applauds! This always feels great, I'm specially excited when people say this
is their first open source contribution ever!  <a href="https://twitter.com/PyBeeWare/status/996482510992367616">This year the supply of coins
was finished in the second
day</a>, I guess we'll
have to be better prepared for next year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this year I could stay only for two days of sprints, because I
had another event in NYC (where I also met some more dear friends, btw).
Still, I'm happy I could make it for some days, and we got quite a few bugs
fixed in <a href="https://pybee.org/voc">VOC</a> during that.</p>
<p>So yeah, Pycon is great, if you're in doubt if you would enjoy, you should just
go the next time!  You don't even need to like Python that much to get a kick
out of it.</p>
<p>Thank you, Pycon, for bringing so much joy and for bringing together so many
people that I love. To all the organizers, volunteers and everyone: y'all rock!</p>
<p>Now I'll do my best to keep surviving without seeing y'all until next year!</p>
