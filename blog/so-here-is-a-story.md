after graduating, I went to work as a software developer for a big
public company in Brazil. This company is responsible for a huge part of
the country's IT infrastructure, and they keep trying to build a
reputation of being innovative and pro open source, the kind of thing
that excited me a lot. I thought:</span><span
style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">*"They
promote Linux and free software... Heck, their website is built with
Plone. I'll get to do cool stuff in Python all day!"*</span><span
style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">
I know it's naive, but that was my thinking back then.</span>

initially I thought I had won the lottery. But that feeling didn't take
long to dissipate. What I ended up finding was NOT a place where
engineers are working together on great projects, embracing free
software and releasing good stuff to the world.</span>

company is weird. And the biggest problem for me was: I was young and
inexperienced, a child basically, surrounded mostly by other children.
You see, most developers there are pretty smart people. But they don't
have much say in the decisions about the software development, arguably
the thing they know best.</span>

<div dir="ltr"
style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">

<span
style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The
software development department is </span><span
style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15; white-space: pre-wrap;">run </span><span
style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 17.25px; white-space: pre-wrap;">mostly</span><span
style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.15; white-space: pre-wrap;">by
traditional managers who don't seem to understand how software
development actually works. It seems that it has been on deficit for
quite some time, though nobody cares too much -- hey, the taxpayers are
still funding it.</span>

</div>

<div dir="ltr"
style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">

<span
style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So,
those managers wanted the Big Ole' Software Factory. You know, those
imaginary places with human machinery resembling an assembly line that
if you set up just right and feed it with the right input, you'll get
good software on the other end.</span>

</div>

<div dir="ltr"
style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">

<span
style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Well,
what they've got is a bunch of talented people managed in a very
paternalistic style. And that leads to painful frustration for the
developers who, being treated like children, end up behaving a lot like
children (myself included, I am ashamed to say).</span>

</div>

<div dir="ltr"
style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">

<span
style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I
don't need to tell you that they don't produce great software. Well,
when they get to ship something, that is. But I'm not talking about the
quality of their software right now.</span>

</div>

<div dir="ltr"

<span

now, my point is: this kind of place is not a good place for someone
trying to grow into a good, mature engineer.</span>

</div>

<div dir="ltr"
style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">

<span
style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">You
need a healthy environment to build up maturity and excellence. And an
environment is not healthy if you are encouraged to simply follow orders
and maintain the status quo. Because you won't learn to make better
decisions if you are not supposed to be trusted to decide very basic
things, like what software to install in your development
machine.</span>

</div>

<div dir="ltr"

at that company end up having serious trust issues with their bosses and
colleagues because of the unhealthy environment. The funny thing is, I
think most people are there because they like the job security, but they
don't get to feel really safe much. At least, not the majority of the
people I knew there. They are often afraid that "someone is out to get
them".</span>

back then, and I wish everybody there would read that book now and give
it some serious thought. That would bring some light to several of the
issues they have there, and maybe the place would be better than it
is.</span>

remember getting there full of energy, eager to learn and do stuff.
Somewhere along the way, I kind of lost the will. I remember thinking:
"Okay, I give up, I don't know how to deal with this. I'll remain a
mediocre performer, as that seems what they want around here. I will
focus on honing my guitar skills, so that I won't want to kill
myself."</span>

I moved on to greener pastures some time ago, though not before another
experience at another not-so-great government institution. And although
I'm not young anymore, I think I've managed to stay curious and I'm
still eager to learn and do stuff. That's the important thing,
right?</span>

sometimes, looking back at how much I have improved after leaving that
place, I can't help but wonder what if I had never gone there in the
first place? Would I be able to enjoy working, learning and growing as I
do now? Or would I be like so many others out there, whining and
thinking I would be happier enjoying the job security of a public
employee?</span>

guess I'll never know. It's probably better thinking it would be the
latter, though. That way I'll have no regrets.</span>
