            <p>In the past week I've fully revamped my <a href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles/drum-game">drum
game</a> that I had initially written like 10
years ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://eliasdorneles.com/drum-game/">Play it here</a></p>
<h2>The Revamp Story</h2>

</div>
<p>Did I use agent coding? Well, yes, I did!</p>
<p>I also used Gemini for some help improving the copy.</p>
<p>Actually I used this game project to try Claude Code again, since I had paid
for an annual subscription which I was not using at all, after getting
disenchanted with AI agent coding assistance.</p>
<p>Btw, I am sure I'm not the only person who have gone through a phase like this,
and it might be not even my last one -- I might need a break from AI coding
assistance in the future again. As a programmer who really <em>enjoys</em> to program,
I am clearly mourning a certain loss of something, maybe the relevance of some
abilities that I had worked hard to build, like typing fast, or generally using
my creativity to write code.</p>
<p>Anyway, I had read some news about how agent coding had got much better over
the past 6 months and saw some colleagues having some good successes with it,
so I decided to give it another chance.</p>
<p>I'm glad I did, because I've got some good results with my game project, I
managed to implement -- gosh, I feel ashamed of using the word <em>implement</em>
when most of the code changes were done by the coding agent in &quot;vibecoding&quot;
mode... anyway, I managed to <em>get done</em> several features that were sitting on a
<a href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles/drum-game/blob/master/PLAN.md">to-do list</a>
for <em>years</em> which I had never had the energy to implement previously.</p>
<p>It allowed me to greatly improve the game, and I have a bunch of ideas for what
to do next.</p>
<h3>Adding a level editor</h3>
<p>One big enabler was adding a level editor, something that I wanted to do but wasn't sure exactly how to begin.</p>
<p>Until a few days ago, adding a level had to be done editing a JSON file. You
know, okay for simple patterns, but not a good workflow to work with music. To
be able to design better levels, I needed a way to be able to quickly preview a
drum loop, make adjustments and check the result.</p>
<p>It took like 3 or 4 prompts to have a nice usable level editor that I could use
right away. This alone already allowed me to make the game much better, with
more interesting and musical drum patterns, and got me very excited.</p>
<p>The level editor looks like this:</p>

<h2>Coding with AI</h2>
<p>So yeah, I guess I am back to using AI for coding again.</p>
<p>I am worried of getting hooked to it and becoming &quot;dumb&quot;, because there is
clearly a big dopamine hit when things work, and it can get addictive.</p>
<p>For production work, I will need to be a lot more careful and disciplined than
what I can get away with on a weekend project like my drum game. So, we'll see!</p>
<h3>Usage limits</h3>
<p>I did bump into the usage limits after like 40 prompts or so, that was a bit annoying. I didn't
do anything special to optimize my token usage except compacting the conversations a few times.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't feel like doing that -- using the lesser model would be less
reliable, and I can live with the limit. It is a good reminder that these tools
are expensive and energy-intensive, so it's a good thing to be mindful about
how much I use it anyway, and maybe this way I won't rely on it too much.
Working in bursts is fine by me.</p>
<h3>Conclusion?</h3>
<p>I am excited about the possibilities of creating more things!</p>
<p>At the same time, I'm mourning the value loss about manually written code
and relevance of some of my hard-earned abilities.
I am also worried about the cost of this kind of technology and the power that
it gives to people that will use it for malicious purposes...</p>
<p>I hope that it will be used more for good than for evil!</p>
<p>I believe in the world there is just enough love to prevent hate from
destroying everything, I hope it will continue to be the case!</p>
