            <p>Some days ago I read <a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/08/29/co-routines-as-an-alternative-to-state-machines">this nice article talking about co-routines as an
alternative to state
machines</a>.</p>
<p>The most popular use case for co-routines in Python has been asynchronous I/O,
and there are a bunch of Python things that use them (like
<a href="https://twistedmatrix.com">Twisted</a>, <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org">Tornado</a> and
the standard library module
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">asyncio</a> which appeared in
Python 3.4).</p>
<p>Apart from the async stuff, I find quite hard to think up use cases for
co-routines, they mostly look like complicated stuff that smart people have a
lot of trouble to make it useful.</p>
<p>So I was curious about this idea of using co-routines as alternative for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">state
machines</a>, because state
machines are kind of everywhere, even if not always explicitly.</p>
<p>I've seen a few other examples that kinda made sense, like David's <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/pyos8.py">scheduler
for cooperative tasks</a>, and a
discrete event simulation in the book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do">Fluent
Python</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/ramalhoorg">Luciano
Ramalho</a>, but these still seem a bit far away
for me.</p>
<p>So I decided to test out for myself reimplementing some simple state
machine as a co-routine and see how it goes.</p>
<h2>Are co-routines an alternative to state machines?</h2>
<p>To try out the idea, I decided to write a small program using a state machine,
and then write a co-routine version of it. I decided to implement a naive
program to strip out C-style comments.</p>
<p>I must say that this is not production code, it ignores the case of comments
inside of a string (as in <code>'/**/'</code> for the sake of simplicity). I only wrote
this to explore the idea of alternatives to state machines.</p>
<p>Here is a diagram of the state machine:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="../../..//images/fsm_strip_comments.png" alt="Picture with diagram of Finite State machine" /></p>
</center>
<p><a href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles/lazy-eval-gt-state-machines/blob/master/001_state_machine.py">Here is the state machine implementation</a>.</p>
<p>It was fairly straightforward to implement, but the code ends up a bit verbose.</p>
<p>Next, I went on and wrote <a href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles/lazy-eval-gt-state-machines/blob/master/002_coroutine.py">the co-routine version</a>, and didn't really like the result.
First of all, I find a bit cumbersome having to write the sink and build the driving code,
I thought: &quot;why can't I just use the function? what if I want to do something
else than just print, do I have to write a sink-like code every time?&quot;</p>
<p>After mulling for a bit, I realized that the most important gain from the
co-routine code was being able to &quot;pause execution&quot;, so I figured I could write
a generator function that would consume the input lazily. While attempting
to do that, I realized I don't even need it to be a generator, it can
be just a regular function that will consume the input lazily and
return the full results.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles/lazy-eval-gt-state-machines/blob/master/004_imperative_final.py">that's what I did, and decided that I like this code more than the co-routine version</a>.
I think it allows you to skip thinking about the explicit states when writing
the code, it's lazy and it's easy to use (just a regular function).</p>
<p>I'm not sure if it's better than the state machine version, though,
because I think to read it and understand you sort of have to build a
mental model of the states in your head. So it seems easier to write,
but may be tougher to read.
I think for state machines with high number of states this would not be
good for maintainability, and you'd probably want have a diagram.</p>
<p>I also had <a href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles/lazy-eval-gt-state-machines/commit/458fb7e124dff3bb06a9f61b62453507ad0c3d75">a bug on the first
implementation</a>,
which I only noticed when writing this blog post and <a href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles/lazy-eval-gt-state-machines/blob/master/diagram.dot">creating the state
machine
diagram</a>
and then had to go back and <a href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles/lazy-eval-gt-state-machines/commit/0bb8092a7d7b80aae34ef95af1334657ffd04ff5">fix it in the other implementations</a>.
Fixing the bug was a lot easier for the state machine implementation.</p>
<h2>Conclusions, or, how I feel about this</h2>
<p>State machines are complicated, but they're very useful. Even if it takes some
effort to understand them, I feel it's still less effort than co-routines.</p>
<p>Co-routines are also complicated, I find they demand too much cognition
to work with and can be harder to debug than regular state machine code.</p>
<p>Combining lazy evaluation and Python functions probably work better as an
alternative of state machines than co-routines, because they give you the
benefits without most of the drawbacks.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if they're as much powerful nor I'm convinced that the code is
more maintainable, but for some state machines it may be very expressive.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles/lazy-eval-gt-state-machines/blob/master/005_pro.py">regular expressions are awesome</a>. =)</p>
