            <p>Ever since I started using the awesome <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pudb">pudb debugger for Python
programs</a> I've been curious about the <a href="http://urwid.org/">urwid
library</a>, an user interface library for console-based
applications that the debugger uses. The <a href="http://urwid.org/examples/index.html">examples in the
gallery</a> are just gorgeous!</p>
<p>So last week I decided I would write a console-based game and learn Urwid in the process.
I decided to implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience_(game)">Solitaire clone (specifically, the Klondike form)</a>.
I thought it would be fun to draw the cards using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character">box-drawing characters</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_cards_in_Unicode">card symbols</a> available in Unicode.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the final game:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eliasdorneles/usolitaire/master/screenshot-usolitaire.png" alt="Screenshot showing usolitaire" /></p>
<p>Before starting to code, I explored the library a bit in the shell, following <a href="http://urwid.org/tutorial/index.html">the examples from the tutorial</a>.
I also did <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eliasdorneles/usolitaire/c18b4643bcd20cf53705a16de6072f2d1e766a43/PLAN.txt">some planning</a>, working out how to draw the game elements so that it would fit a 40x80 characters terminal window.</p>
<p>Then it was time to start coding, I started by trying to write something that I could put in the screen, a <a href="http://urwid.org/manual/widgets.html">custom widget</a> to represent a card.</p>
<p>After reading about widget layouts and sizings, I thought I wanted a fixed size widget, but my attempts to write one were hard to use, I kept running into <a href="https://github.com/urwid/urwid/wiki/FAQ#what-does-the-attributeerror-xxx-object-has-no-attribute-rows-error-mean">errors that happen when you try to use a fixed widget with things that expect something else</a>.</p>
<p>I was finally able to do it after reading more carefully the <a href="http://urwid.org/manual/widgets.html#custom-widgets">documentation about custom widgets</a> and figured it was easier to use the <code>urwid.WidgetWrap</code> class around a <code>urwid.Text</code> widget drawing the card using line-breaks to break the content.</p>
<p>Overall I found the library nicely documented and very well designed.</p>
<p>I kept running into those errors related to the sizing mode later on, so I had to become a bit more acquainted with the widgets I was using to know if they were box-sizing or flow-sizing mode. I wonder if there is an easier way of dealing with those.</p>
<p>I'm really liking to play with this library, I think I'll try more stuff with it soon.</p>
<p>If you want to play the game, you can install it with:</p>
<pre><code>pip install usolitaire
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles/usolitaire">source code is on Github</a>.</p>
