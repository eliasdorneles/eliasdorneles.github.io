            <p>Those who know me well, know that I'm a bit of a <a href="https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/">Steve
Yegge</a> fanboy. That's true, I love reading
Steve's mean jokes and I keep coming back to those long blog posts. That dude's
writing has been a great influence to me. I've even started to write long posts
myself, in a sort of cargo-cult-steve-yegge-wannabe behavior. I'm such a
fanboy. Steve would probably feel embarrassed for me.</p>
<p>Anyway, I discovered a while ago that he has quietly released a book called <a href="http://www.hyperink.com/A-Programmers-Rantings-On-Programminglanguage-Religions-Code-Philosophies-Google-Work-Culture-And-Other-Stuff-b40632A90DD">A
Programmer's Rantings: On Programming-Language Religions, Code Philosophies,
Google Work Culture and Other
Stuff</a>,
which is a collection of some of his articles put together with a few notes
adding a bit more context to each article. It was published by
<a href="http://hyperink.com/">HyperInk</a>, which seems to be a cool company. I bought
the ebook from their website and it offered me to send as a gift to a few
friends, so it was a nice deal.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hyperink.com/A-Programmers-Rantings-On-Programminglanguage-Religions-Code-Philosophies-Google-Work-Culture-And-Other-Stuff-b40632A90DD"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fsINtrFzTHs/U-f8-2QOj9I/AAAAAAAAAy4/7sWr2RZ8P8I/s1600/40632A90DD_thumb.jpg" alt="Cover of Steve Yegge's Rantings book" title="A Programmer's Rantings: On Programming-Language Religions, Code Philosophies, Google Work Culture and Other Stuff" /></a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/"></a></p>
</center>
<p>And the book is quite a journey. You get to read some of the first essays Steve
wrote when he was pretty unknown (just another bright young fellow at Amazon)
and also his latest rants posted on <a href="https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts">Google
Plus</a>, including the one
he made public accidentally and it ended up making him kind of famous outside
of the programming circles too.</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading this book a lot, although I suppose it would be expected
for me say that, what with me being a fanboy and all. That being said, it's a
quick read and lot's of fun -- highly recommended! Although it amounts to more
than two hundred pages it still does not make half of the stuff on
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/blog-rants">his</a>
<a href="https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com.br/">blogs</a>.  So, if you like the book, you'll
probably want to check out the blogs.  Or vice-versa, whatever.</p>
