            <p>We programmers often prefer to work in problems that we already know how to
solve, and tend to avoid hard ones that don't have a straightforward solution.
Sure we like to think that we love a challenge, but given the choice of
something easy to solve and another that requires thinking more deeply, one
will choose to work in the easy one -- regardless of which one is more
important. We're biased to tools and techniques that we already know and are comfortable
with, we favor solutions we don’t need to think much.</p>

<p>By hard problem, I don't mean just something you have never done before but
you're reasonably confident that you can learn how to do it -- you know,
solving a known problem in a different language/technology, these kinds of
things that we like to do sometimes to avoid boredom. I'm talking about problems that you have
no clue how to solve (or even if it’s solvable) and no idea if you can learn
how to solve it. Problems you're afraid of even trying to tackle.</p>
<p>To be fair, this is just human nature, it's not a limitation of programmers
only: most people in similar circumstances will act the same way. And many
times this is okay, it's often not a big deal to do the thing requiring less
energy, we even design products around this behavior of choosing the easy. It's
only human that we will tend to do the easy instead of the hard, and many times
it’s even the wisest thing to do.</p>
<p>Now, what if these hard problems are really the important ones? How do we
decide if they’re really important? What can we do about this natural tendency
of avoiding them? What can you do to make yourself more willing to at least
attempt to solve them? I’ve been thinking about this lately, and I don’t really
have a straight answer.</p>
<p>I suppose it has a bit to do with attitude, a feeling that it will be worth to
give it a try even if you don’t succeed. I suspect the fear of failure is big
for many programmers. Our own expectations for a possible solution are
increasing by the minute, however our ability to learn doesn’t scale at the same proportion.
So we conclude we’re not up to the challenge and give up without really trying,
thus not building resilience while learning from failures, which would be
precisely what would help when tackling a tough problem.</p>
<p>We’re eager to believe in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/team-geek/9781449329839/ch01.html">the myth of the genius programmer</a>, which helps to
increase our insecurity. Most programmers have some personal heroes, and that’s
not a bad thing, but it’s good to remind ourselves these heroes are just
people, not that different from you and me. I bet they see themselves as just
people working in hard problems. In some cases they might’ve been privileged
with early access to technology or guidance from knowledgeable people, but I
have the feeling that our heroes are mostly just people who are willing to give
it a try and keep at it.</p>
<p>It’s nice to pay attention on what may be causing us to avoid difficult
problems, and seek to understand which are the sources of anxiety, what are the
risks and fears involved. Hopefully this will help us to see more clearly and
make better decisions about what we should be working on. Because it’s easy to
avoid important work if you’re rushing to do everything fast, fearing to fail
or disappoint someone or just being too busy to spend time thinking.</p>
<p>Sure there will be times when we’ll be too underprepared for a problem. But maybe we
should try it either way, perhaps in a safe environment. At the very minimum we’d learn
a bit more about the problem and maybe grow a better understanding of what to
learn before trying again.
Who knows, <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/04/to-find-happiness-at-work-tap/">this might end up being a good heuristic for increasing happiness</a>.</p>
