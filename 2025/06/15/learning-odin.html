            <p>Over the past month or so I've been learning <a href="https://odin-lang.org/">Odin</a> and
I'm enjoying it so much that I'm breaking the silence on the blog.</p>
<p>I was quite into <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> for a while, but Odin seems more
mature at this point and, honestly, much more learnable and easier to make
things work. Writing Odin makes me remember what it was like when I started
writing Python -- that feeling of <em>&quot;it can't be this easy, can it??&quot;</em>. I still
like Zig, but Odin is just more... fun? And much faster to learn, I feel.</p>
<p>I like that &quot;joy of programming&quot; is one of the principles behind it. I also
like the vibe of &quot;have fun, make something&quot; that seems to come from the
community, maybe particularly from people like <a href="https://zylinski.se/">Karl
Zylinksi</a>, who wrote <a href="https://odinbook.com/">an Odin
book</a> and made some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@karl_zylinski">great tutorials for Odin and
Raylib</a>, among others.</p>
<p>In the world of AI agents that can spit code faster than you can say
&quot;supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot;, I believe <em>joy</em> becomes even more
important for enjoying the activity of programming.</p>
<p>What I've made so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>toyed around with raylib, which comes installed with Odin, and for which there
are some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@karl_zylinski">great tutorials</a>, from the
same Odin book fellow aforementioned.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles/odin-jack-example-clients">odin-jack-example-clients</a>:
I ported some example programs for the <a href="https://jackaudio.org/api/">JACK Audio
API</a> from C to Odin: a program that generates a
sine wave, one that reads MIDI events and sends audio to the output device,
and another which records from the microphone and saves a WAVE file. Audio
programming is a long-term journey for me and has been one of the main
motivations for me to get back to low-level programming again after many
years of mostly doing Python.</li>
<li>this very website (<a href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles/eliasdorneles.github.io">source code
here</a>), which I've
migrated from Pelican to <a href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles/eliasdorneles.github.io/tree/source/sitegen">my own custom static site
generator</a>,
which includes a tiny Jinja-like template engine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can't wait to make something else!</p>
