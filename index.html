<p>I had stumbled upon it before at Pycon US earlier, they had a booth set up
and their website said &quot;BeeWare, the IDEs of Python&quot;.</p>
<p>I didn't gave much attention at it at first, because I've kinda given up on
IDEs some time ago. Every now and then I try Pycharm (which seems to be one of
the best UI for Python development out there) and always end up getting back to
Vim. An open source replacement for Pycharm definitely sounded cool, but still
didn't seem much more than a bunch of developers tools born out of yak-shaving.</p>
<p>However, while there is some fun yak-shaving involved, it's just a teeny tiny
part of the picture.</p>

reviewer asked me to <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Squashing-Commits">squash the

I had no idea what they were talking about. I didn't have any friends who knew
Git, I was pretty much a noob on Git and GitHub. It's easy to forget how scary
this stuff can be for someone just starting out with their first open source
contribution.</p>

as possible to ask for someone to rebase their code in a pull request, unless I

<p>I've shared this text almost as-is internally at @Scrapinghub, the company I work at. As it had a good response, I'm sharing it here after some minor editing. I wrote it mainly to my programmer friends, but many people will probably relate to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some things that I want to share with you:</p>
<p>If you’ve ever felt that you’re a mediocre developer at best, even though you show up and do your best everyday, you’re not alone.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever felt bad about not being nearly as productive as you’d want to, you’re not alone.</p>
<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
<p>If you’ve ever thought that you will probably be fired eventually because you’re not as smart and accomplished as your peers and “someday they’ll figure that out”, you’re not alone.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever refrained from introducing an idea out of fear of being ridiculed or laughed at, you’re not alone.</p>
<p>If the thought ever crossed your mind that you’re a fraud waiting to be uncovered, that everyone is smarter and better and faster and more knowledgeable than you, I want to tell you that you’re not alone.</p>
<p>Most of us go through that at least at some point, sometimes every day. And the thing is, there <em>are</em> ways for us to overcome these feelings that, even if we don’t completely eliminate them, it help us to grow both personally and professionally.</p> </div>

    <div class="postsummary"> <p>We programmers often prefer to work in problems that we already know how to
solve, and tend to avoid hard ones that don't have a straightforward solution.
Sure we like to think that we love a challenge, but given the choice of
something easy to solve and another that requires thinking more deeply, one
will choose to work in the easy one -- regardless of which one is more
important. We're biased to tools and techniques that we already know and are comfortable
with, we favor solutions we don’t need to think much.</p> </div>

    <div class="postsummary"> <p>Alguns meses atrás descobri o <a href="http://29a.ch/playitslowly/" title="http://29a.ch/playitslowly/">Play it slowly</a>, um programa para tocar arquivos de áudio em
velocidades ou alturas diferentes, no Linux. Você pode usá-lo para, por
exemplo, ouvir uma música no mesmo tom da original mas com um ritmo bem mais
lento (útil para aprender as notas de um solo complicado), ou ainda ouvir um
<em>podcast</em> numa velocidade um pouco mais rápida sem transformar a voz do
palestrante na de um ratinho. (Tem um equivalente para Windows, <a href="http://bestpractice.sourceforge.net" title="http://bestpractice.sourceforge.net">Best
Practice</a>, grátis e livre assim como o Play it
slowly).</p> </div>

    <div class="postsummary"> <p>Dias atrás estava debatendo com alguns amigos, tentando demonstrar como não era
muito intuitivo o jeito que acostumamos a pensar sobre consumo de combustível,
para efeito de comparação. Perguntei a eles o que fariam se tivessem dois
carros, um sedã que fizesse 10km/L e uma camionete que fizesse 5km/L, e
tivessem que escolher entre o upgrade da camionete para uma que fizesse 10km/L
ou o upgrade do sedã para um que fizesse 35km/L.  Todos me disseram que iriam
obviamente com a segunda opção.</p> </div>
